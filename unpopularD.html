            <p>The further you get from the city centre, the higher are the chances of seeing more green. Tsuen Wan Park is built along the coast near the pier, with a charming maritime theme adopted into its design. Within the green oasis, there is an artificial lake and waterfall lined with trees to provide shade and bring coolness into the air circulation during summer. Itâ€™s the perfect, most tranquil spot to get away from all of your worries and let the calming sounds of the waterfall wash them away.</p>
